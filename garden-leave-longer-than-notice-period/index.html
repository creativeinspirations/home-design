The statutory minimum period of notice where you have been employed one month or more is 1 week. Your employer can request you refrain from getting in touch with their clients, customers, suppliers, or contacts without their prior consent. My employment start date was 1st april 2005.

<p>At the same time, you also have to be on standby in case your employer still requires all or part of your services for the garden leave period. Strictly speaking, a person can only be placed on garden leave once he has resigned with notice or been dismissed with notice. If it is not stated you need to give one week’s notice if you have worked for your employer for more than one month. With your employer’s agreement, you can use your annual leave to offset the notice period in exchange for bringing forward your last day of employment. Garden leave is when an employee completes their notice period away from the workplace, whilst still receiving pay and benefits as normal.
