Most plastic folding chairs will be advertised with a weight capacity of 800 pounds but that doesnt mean an 800 pound person or anything close to that weight should be anywhere near these chairs. Some BIFMA members have recently tested general-purpose chairs with static loads of 1000 lbs. Our big and tall chairs weight limits vary depending on the chair youre. In particular you may have noticed that most of the camp chairs on the market today have an upper weight limit of about 300-pounds which renders them completely useless to you.

<p>Bifma- also known longhand as Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association- has put. Big and tall chairs however can handle anywhere between 300 to 800 pounds. Responsible manufacturers would never make a user weight recommendation of 1000 lbs. Chairs that have been BIFMA tested could have the potential to hold more than the 250 pounds. That means electric wheelchairs are generally too heavy and clients will need to transfer to a manual wheelchair or shower chair in order to be weighed.

<p>Given that most conventional furniture is capable of supporting between 250 and 300 pounds we defined a high weight capacity folding chair as being one that could support at least 400 pounds. Which is crazy to me. If the chair can not lift your weight accurately it can not provide you the right sitting posture and cause lots of pain. In particular you may have noticed that most of the camp chairs on the market today have an upper weight limit of about 300-pounds which renders them completely useless to you. After testing our folding chairs against competitors both rated at an 800 pound capacity our chairs collapsed at a weight of 720 pounds.
