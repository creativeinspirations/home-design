<p>A garage door opener remote is a convenient tool but when it only works at close distances or stops working altogether it can be frustrating. It should be hanging down to allow the signal to reach it well. Then open and close the door. The garage door may attempt to go down but will come right back up and the overhead light on the garage door opener will blink. Remove the 2 wires then touch them together see if it the door starts to open or close and if it does separate the 2 wires and allow the door to close or open fully.

<p>All new garage door openers operate on a different frequency than the old openers. Wiggle the bracket the eyes are attached to maybe just it is loose or the slightest bit of movement may cause the light to blink. Hard wired button works. Remove the 2 wires then touch them together see if it the door starts to open or close and if it does separate the 2 wires and allow the door to close or open fully. We have three wireless remotes one is the built in remote in our car one is one of the original portable units and the other is a wireless keypad outside the garage door.
