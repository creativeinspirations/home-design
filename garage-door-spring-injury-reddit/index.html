<p>Larger overhead doors are often 16. I thought both springs were broken on a two car garage. The truth is that I didnt even know it was broken until I returned to find that the garage door would no longer go up with the push of the button. But without them your door would be unable to properly function. To get injured by them you need to be up close and working on them. Overhead Door Remote O1t.</p>

<p>Nylon springs dont take grease so avoid lubricating those as well. Preventing garage door accidents at work is similar to preventing garage door accidents at home. A garage door with a broken spring should not be opened or closed using an automatic operator. I thought both springs were broken on a two car garage. By far the biggest reason for garage door spring failure is simple wear and tear. Home Manxfarms.</p>
