<p>The myQ app supports myQ-enabled products from Chamberlain LiftMaster. Traditional garage door remotes have their benefits but they also have their limitations including very limited range. Since the feature was introduced my wifes door always showed up in the CarPlay dashboard for Siri suggestions. Download the GarageSmart app to conveniently remotely and securely open close or monitor up to three individual garage doors anywhere with your Android phone or tablet. This devices acts as a HomeKit bridge into the Chamberlain environment and you assign each opener to the bridge. Apple Wwdc 2019 Gives Carplay Its Biggest Update Yet Roadshow.</p>

<p>Does anyone with apple CarPlay who also has a MyQ garage door opener that allows you to open your garage door with your phone know if you can use your infotainment screen to open your garage. 4 Wait for the CarPlay user interface to appear on your cars display and verify that your desired garage door opener appears in the bottom right corner. See if it keeps the original door in CarPlay. With iOS 13 and CarPlay a garage door button will display when you get close. Removing one and testing would be the only way to tell and possibly fix which one displays. Hubitat For Apple Carplay Feature Requests Hubitat.</p>
