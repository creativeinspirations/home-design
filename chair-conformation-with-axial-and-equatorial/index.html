<p>The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. In the previous two posts we have talked about drawing the ring-flip of chair conformations and the A value 13-diaxial interactionsAnd we learned that for a given cyclohexane the axial conformer is less stable than the corresponding equatorial conformerFor example the energy difference of the axial and equatorial isopropyl cyclohexane is 92 kJmol. After undergoing a ring flip the isopropyl becomes equatorial. These two conformers are not identical and they dont have the same energy.

Once you have drawn all of the bonds in a Newman projection you merely fill in the blanks at the end of each line. Draw the equatorial substituent up or down the reverse of the axial substituent.

<p>The equatorial C H bonds project out-ward from the ring around its equator Steps to help you learn to draw the chair con-formation of cyclohexane including the axial and equatorial hydrogens are provided in. I know how to draw a chair conformation. The most stable conformation is the chair. If the tert-butyl group is placed in the axial bond then the chair has the highest energy or the least stable conformation. The UP position on an UP carbon of the ring is AXIAL.

If the tert-butyl group is placed in the axial bond then the chair has the highest energy or the least stable conformation. The UP position on an UP carbon of the ring is AXIAL. Axial and equatorial are types of bonds found in the chair conformation of cyclohexane.

<p>If the tert-butyl group is placed in the axial bond then the chair has the highest energy or the least stable conformation. Chair Conformation Axial And Equatorial. These two conformers are not identical and they dont have the same energy. In the previous two posts we have talked about drawing the ring-flip of chair conformations and the A value 13-diaxial interactionsAnd we learned that for a given cyclohexane the axial conformer is less stable than the corresponding equatorial conformerFor example the energy difference of the axial and equatorial isopropyl cyclohexane is 92 kJmol.
