            <p>The chair conformation is the most stable due to the following reasons. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. chair boat conformation more stable.</p>
<p><strong>Chair Boat Conformation More Stable</strong>, This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. The key difference between chair and boat conformation is that a chair conformation has low energy whereas a boat conformation has high energy. The chair conformation allows it to have the closest possible angle which would be 1109 degreesDue to this the strain reduces and results in a lowered energy.</p>

<p>The boat conformation is again a puckered structure that allows tetrahedral bond angles. The boat conformation has unfavorable steric interactions between a pair of 14 hydrogens the so-called flagpole hydrogens that are. Generally the chair conformation is the most stable structure of cyclohexane at room temperature.</p>
<h3 id="chair-and-boat-shapes-for-cyclohexane">Chair and Boat Shapes for Cyclohexane.</h3><p>The twist boat conformation has less steric and torsion strain as compared to half chair conformation and It is 55kcalmol less stable than the chair form. In this way which conformation is more stable. The boat conformation suffers from torsional strain making it less stable higher in energy than the chair. Generally the chair conformation is the most stable structure of cyclohexane at room temperature. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. Up to now we have not described in detail the rotational path of cyclohexane and what is the end result.</p>

<p>While the boat conformation of cyclohexane is somewhat less stable because it has two types ring st. Well then how is the twist-boat conformation possibly stable. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. The difference between the two forms is about 102 kJmol. Which is more stable chair or boat conformation You should be able to quickly draw cyclohexane rings in which the axial and equatorial bonds are readily identifiable and distinguishable.

<p>The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. The carbons in cyclohexane have sp3 hybridization and hence they tend to have an angle of 1095 degrees. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. The answer is because of the torsional and steric strains which are more present in a boat conformation. The boat conformation is an intermediate between the chair conformation and the twist-boat conformation. Solution Of Chapter 1 Problems Carruthers Book Organic Chemistry Books Chapter Books.</p>

<p>Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. This is for two reasons. This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. You just need to find the energy value for the axial group. When the 2nd and 3rd act as the axis of rotation the 1st and 4th can become cl.

<p>This is for two reasons. The boat conformation is quite flexible. This video explains in details the conformation energy of cycloalkanes. When the 2nd and 3rd act as the axis of rotation the 1st and 4th can become cl. So choosing the more stable chair conformation is straightforward when there is only one group on the cyclohexane.
