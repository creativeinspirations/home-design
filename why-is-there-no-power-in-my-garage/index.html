<p>There are no visible access or blank cover plate anywhere in the house. Should be 110 to 120 volts from the breaker leg to the neutral ground if its a single pole breaker or 220 to 240 volts across the two breaker legs if its a two pole. Surge protection is the key way to prevent this from happening. I did test the voltage again it went up to 230v at the main garage board near main electric supply tested the switch and garage showing same voltage but still nothing is working in the garage. Either i have the wrong breaker or there is a hidden junction box somewhere behind the wall.

<p>Somebody stole my thunder. Assuming I tripped the breaker I went to the panel however the breaker did not trip. Turns out the breaker also shuts off my fridge outlet. If this does not restore power to the receptacles the problem may be a GFCI type receptacle has tripped and needs to be reset. Unless of course you have a second meter but that would show up on your power bill as a 2nd service.

<p>That tells you something. Somebody stole my thunder. But from looking at it I would need to dig up their parking infront to run electric cable. The breaker did not trip but I filped it off and on I think you call that resetting the breaker - - however there still is no power. Its also possible that the supply to the garage has been run from one of the houses sockets circuits via a Fused Connection Unit FCU aka fused switch somewhere - if that were he case the fuse may have blown or it might even have got switched off.

<p>So you shut off your main panels main breaker and your garage didnt trip. Went back and tested again at the main garage board it has dropped to 210v also the same readings down the line till the garage. Has anyone got any ideas how to get it there rather than digging up his parking or. I can probably use an extension lead every now and again from the house to hoover.

<p>Anyway once you rule out the GFCI and the circuit breaker you then check for power at the receptacles.
