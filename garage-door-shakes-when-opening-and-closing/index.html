<p>It will only close if I adjust the downward strength of the opener. The first thing that a technician will do is check your door runners and the pulley. If your garage door makes a loud noise when opening or closing especially a squeaking or grinding noise the problem may be with the rollers. The garage door track guides the rollers at the ends of panels to keep the garage door moving smoothly. A garage door opener that is shaking really hard when opening or closing is the warning sign of a bigger problem. A Cottage With Character Garage Door Design Garage House House Exterior.</p>
