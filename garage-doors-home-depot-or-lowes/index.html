<p>It seems Lowes and Home Cheapo have many choices of steel and fiberglass doors but a few contractor friends have told me to stay away from these two chains for quality reasons. Instead of purchasing a garage door from your rose you should compare prices and services at Home Depot. The doors need to be insulated steel with steel interior. Clopay Modern Steel 9 ft. Clopay offers enhanced durability for long-lasting value and increased energy efficiency by keeping the elements out and reducing noise.
