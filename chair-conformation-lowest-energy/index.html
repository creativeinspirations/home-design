<p>Calculating Flip Energy. This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. Is lowest energy conformation most stable. Carefully study this molecule by rotating it on your screen. Run a molecular dynamics simulation in order to get a sense of the flexibility of the cyclohexane ring. Cyclohexane Chair Conformation Stability Which One Is Lower Energy.</p>
