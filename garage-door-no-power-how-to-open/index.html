<p>Before we attempt to disengage our door opener into our garage door we must be sure that our garage door is down. Having the door closed before entering manual operation will prevent a sudden drop of the door. When the power returns returning to an automated mode is trivial. Of course this is a great security risk so youll have to weigh the options on whether installing a secure shield or being able to engage your door manually from outside is more important. While its not always red this is an emergency cord with a handle that can be used in situations just like this.

<p>Even if your power is out you should still disconnect the power cord from your garage door opener. I undid them and the coupling holding the opening mechanism to the door let go and I was able to manually open the door. Take this step before you do anything else to open the door manually. Obviously if the power goes out when the door is open you have no control over this see the next reminder. Or in this case flip the trigger.
