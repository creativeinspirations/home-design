<p>Why does my car have no power when AC is on. Went into garage detached last night to get something out of freezer and neither light nor freezer working. Its consuming some extra power which puts a little extra load on engine so the engine has to shift some power to AC compressor and hence compensates with power to drive. It can be identified by test and reset buttons on its face. I cant figure out why I still have power on. Aedriel The Faux Mudroom Home Home Diy Home Organization.</p>

<p>Betenbough Homes Warranty Team Member Jim talks about how to restore power in your garage through the GFCI outlet on the front porch. Based on the age of your house the garage door opener might not be GFCI protected and that leads me to believe you have a loose connection somewhere. If your home is out of power and you have no backup sources your garage will be stuck in the closed position. Circuit breakers may also appear to be intact not tripped but in reality is just sitting in between position. If your garage is detached or separate from the house it is possible that there is a loose wiring connection problem or a break in the line coming from the main building.
