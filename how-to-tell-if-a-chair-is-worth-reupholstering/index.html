<p>If the chair isnt that old andor isnt especially nice then I dont think it is worth it. So I think it is worth it if I can get the chair frame for a good price and if the workmanship on the chair is exquisite. If it has a sentimental connection to your past it may be worth spending the money on reupholstering. In other words the master craftsmen have retired and havent been replaced at a high rate. Look at the bottom frame and make sure its hardwood and kiln-dried. Pin On Crafts.</p>

<p>The first clue when identifying antique furniture is that most machine-made pieces date post-1860. If the chair isnt that old andor isnt especially nice then I dont think it is worth it. But sometimes once the old upholstery has been taken off then other issues present themselves such as requiring new foam new webbing and getting loose joints repaired. Choose a new fabric that can stand up to wear and tear and replace the padding too if necessary. I recently inherited a chair my grandmother owned and while I dont know if it is an antique or not it holds a lot of sentimental value to me.

<p>Second rule is either go for something super cheap that is a no-brainer or splurge on something that is a standout piece that will make a room. How old is the chair. Here are some things to think about when deciding if its worth reupholstering a chair. Take pictures of the chair before removing the fabric and padding labeling everything as you go. While the cost of reupholstering an individual couch cushion or pillow may not be that high running closer to 50-150 you may have sticker shock when it comes to reupholstering an entire sofa.
