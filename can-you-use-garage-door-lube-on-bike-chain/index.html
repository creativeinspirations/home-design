<p>Its a good practice to lubricate your garage door chain periodically. Dilute it per personal preference with some diesel fuel D2 preferably. Blaster Chain and Cable Lubricant is a long-lasting formula designed specifically for use on any light-duty chain or wire cable applications. Its the best of both worlds since it wont attract dirt and grit a lot but also doesnt need to be applied as often as the other lube types. First close your garage door and ensure the garage door is unplugged from the power outlet.
