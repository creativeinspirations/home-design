<p>In methylcyclohexane the chair conformation in which the large methyl group is equatorial is the most stable and therefore the most populated of all possible conformations. According to the guideline the conformer with larger substituent in equatorial is more stable because if the large group is axial stronger steric strain will be generated and it is less stable. If it has ideal angles then some eclipsing and torsional strain destabilizes it.

<p>The most stable conformation of the cyclohexane ring is called the chair conformation. The conformation about the 3-04 bond is significantly closer to being staggered in the half-chair than in the sofa. The chair conformation has alternating axial up axial down so once you have that single axial substituent move on to.

<p>If the tert-butyl group is placed in the axial bond then the chair has the highest energy or the least stable conformation. This suggests that the conformation about the C3-C4 bond of the dihydropyran ring is similar to the staggered conformation in chair cyclohexanes. The chair conformation is customarily drawn either as 2 or as 3 which are mirror images of each other. Together these features make the chair conformation very stable. Resonance T T T Cl could eq ually well be drawn in the hashed spot A. The Cyclohexane Chair Flip Master Organic Chemistry.</p>

<p>The conformation about the 3-04 bond is significantly closer to being staggered in the half-chair than in the sofa. Drawing boat and chair conformations requires identifying the. However keep in mind that the geometry of the cyclohexane needs to be. There are two different chair conformations that rapidly interchange via a pathway that passes through many different conformations including a high-energy half-chair conformation as well as a twist boat and boat conformations. As taught in this Tutorial Video. Cyclohexane Chair Conformation Stability Which One Is Lower Energy.</p>
