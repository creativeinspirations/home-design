<p>For most classes all you will need to know how to do is use equatorial preference to predict the most stable chair conformation. Number the carbons in your cyclohexane and in your chair. Calculate the total amount of di-axial strain in each conformer and predict which conform is most stable.</p>
<h3 id="at-25-c-9999-of-all-molecules-in-a-cyclohexane-solution-adopt-this-conformation">At 25 C 9999 of all molecules in a cyclohexane solution adopt this conformation.</h3><p>Calculate the total amount of di-axial strain in each conformer and predict which conform is most stable. Finally add an upward-pointing V tip to the other end this is the nose of the chair. All carbon centers are equivalent. Converting Haworth to Chair. Draw both chair conformation ring-flip and use the table to calculate the relative energy cost associated with each group in the axial position to determine the more stable chair conformation of each of the following compounds.
