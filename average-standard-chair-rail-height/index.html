Just remember that growing wishes can out of the blue add square footage you didnt anticipate or want. Lower is always better than higher. Of course everyone always wants the short answer so here it is. What Is The Standard Chair Rail Height.</p>

<p>For stair rail systems installed on or after January 17 2017 the top rail and handrail must be separate. For me a good rule of thumb is to install chair rail molding at 25 of the height of the room. Desk chair heights 1719 inches 18 4550 cm. Footage you didnt expect or need. Determining the standard chair rail height is the first consideration. Laying Out Wainscot Paneling Fine Homebuilding.</p>

<p>To get that approximate chair rail height measure the ceiling height in inches and divide that number by three. If your walls were 10 feet the chair rail height would be 40 inches. If your walls were 8 feet the standard height would be 32 inches. Ill put dark red on the lower walls medium taupe on upper walls light taupe on all trims and an even lighter version of taupe on the ceiling and doors. About 28 to 32 inches is an optimum range for chair rail height says Hull. The Misused Confused Chair Rail Thisiscarpentry.</p>
